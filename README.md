## Abstract
This project analyzes coffee shop sales data sourced from Kaggle to identify trends across products, time periods, and customer purchasing behavior. Using Excel pivot tables, slicers, and interactive dashboards, the raw dataset was transformed into clear insights that can support operational and marketing strategies.

## Introduction
Coffee shops handle large volumes of transactions every day. The challenge lies in making sense of this data to understand what sells, when demand peaks, and how customers behave. This project tackles that challenge by cleaning raw data, exploring it through structured analysis, and presenting findings in an interactive Excel dashboard.

## Methodology
## Data Cleaning
Standardized inconsistent product names
Fixed missing or duplicate records
Converted date and time into usable formats

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Grouped sales by product, weekday, month, and hour
Calculated totals, averages, and comparisons across categories
Explored time-based patterns for demand

## Data Visualization
Excel Dashboard built with:
Pivot tables and slicers for interactivity
Charts showing sales by product, weekday, and month
Line graphs highlighting sales by day

## Key Findings
## Product Performance:
Latte generated the most revenue
Americano with Milk and Cappuccino followed closely
Espresso and Cortado showed weak sales

## Time-Based Trends:
Demand peaked at 9–11 AM and 4–6 PM
Weekdays (especially Monday and Tuesday) outperformed weekends
March and October were top-performing months, while January and April were slow

## Conclusion
The data shows that milk-based and specialty drinks dominate revenue. Demand is steady throughout the day with clear peak hours, and sales patterns suggest weekday-driven activity. Seasonal fluctuations highlight opportunities to strengthen weaker months.

## Recommendations
Optimize staffing for morning and late afternoon peaks
Run promotions in January and April to boost sales
Align inventory planning with weekday-heavy demand
